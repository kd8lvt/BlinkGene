# BlinkGene
A RimWorld mod utilizing the AutoBlink library by Rabiosus  

Somebody asked on [the AutoBlink workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3493889625&searchtext=autoblink) if it is possible to put it on a gene, and BOY is it!  
Technically!  

[Rabiosus](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198078902187) is more than welcome to take, modify, or copy any or all of the code written by me in this repository for use in AutoBlink, though I don't gaurantee quality.
